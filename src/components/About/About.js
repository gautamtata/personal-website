              I started to code very early in my life. I developed my first app in 5th grade of primary school. It was written in QBasic and based on the popular TV Show "Who wants to be a Millionaire".
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              Ever since I was a little kid, I was very curious about the world. My favorite subjects in school were mathematics, physics, and programming. I also loved learning about astronomy.

              I became passionate about Web development after I graduated from college. I started spending a lot of my time online, on websites like TechCrunch and Hacker News. After seeing all those cool apps, innovative startups, and brilliant developers changing our technological landscape on a daily basis, I decided I wanted to become a part of that disruptive movement.
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              So in the last year and half I learned a lot of cool stuff related to front-end and back-end development. I used that knowledge to build my portfolio and this website. I know a lot about NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, jQuery, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, HTML, CSS, CSS-in-JS, TDD, responsive design, progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, a11y, mobile-first design, continuous integration, code transpiling, module bundling, RESTful architecture, API's and more.

              The most inspiring words I ever heard come from the mind of Carl Sagan. He also wrote one of my favorite SciFi novels called "Contact". His reflections are inspired by a photograph of our planet, made by the Voyager 1 space probe as it was leaving our solar system. The photograph is famously known as the "Pale Blue Dot".

              with him reading  those words, as seen in the last scene of the 2014's "Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey" documentary. Every time I watch it I get goosebumps. It inspires in me both humility and hope for a better tomorrow.
